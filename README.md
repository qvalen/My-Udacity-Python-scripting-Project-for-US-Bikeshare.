# Python-scripting-for-US-Bikeshare.
  

## Project Overview  
In this project, I leveraged **Python** to analyze **Bikeshare system data** from three major U.S. cities — **Chicago, New York City, and Washington**.  
Using Python scripting, I imported, processed, and analyzed large datasets to compute **descriptive statistics**, uncovering meaningful patterns in user behavior and ride activity.  

This project demonstrates the power of **Python for data manipulation, analysis, and automation**, enabling efficient exploration of real-world datasets.  


## Objectives  
- Import and clean raw bikeshare data from multiple CSV files.  
- Compute descriptive statistics such as mean travel time, popular stations, and user demographics.  
- Explore data interactively using Python scripts.  
- Generate insights into **commuting behavior**, **trip durations**, and **usage patterns** across cities.  


## Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python** → scripting and automation  
- **Pandas** → data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** → numerical operations  
- **Datetime** → handling date and time data  
- **CSV** → file reading and writing  


## Key Insights  
- **Chicago** recorded the longest average trip duration among the three cities.  
- **New York City** had the highest overall ridership volume.  
- **Washington** displayed more balanced user activity between genders.  
- Peak usage occurred during **weekday commute hours**, suggesting strong ties to urban mobility patterns.  


## Skills Demonstrated  
- Python scripting and automation  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis  
- Real-world data handling with Pandas  
- Data-driven storytelling  


## Outcome  
This project illustrates how **Python scripting** can simplify and scale data analysis workflows.  
Through structured code and reproducible logic, the analysis provides actionable insights into **urban transportation behavior** across U.S. cities.

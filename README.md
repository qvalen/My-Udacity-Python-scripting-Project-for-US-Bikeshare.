# My-Udacity-Python-scripting-Project-for-US-Bikeshare.


# 🚴‍♂️ Python Scripting for U.S. Bikeshare Data Analysis  

## 📘 Project Overview  
In this project, I leveraged **Python** to analyze **Bikeshare system data** from three major U.S. cities — **Chicago, New York City, and Washington**.  
Using Python scripting, I imported, processed, and analyzed large datasets to compute **descriptive statistics**, uncovering meaningful patterns in user behavior and ride activity.  

This project demonstrates the power of **Python for data manipulation, analysis, and automation**, enabling efficient exploration of real-world datasets.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 🧹 Import and clean raw bikeshare data from multiple CSV files.  
- 🧮 Compute descriptive statistics such as mean travel time, popular stations, and user demographics.  
- 🔍 Explore data interactively using Python scripts.  
- 📊 Generate insights into **commuting behavior**, **trip durations**, and **usage patterns** across cities.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python** → scripting and automation  
- **Pandas** → data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** → numerical operations  
- **Datetime** → handling date and time data  
- **CSV** → file reading and writing

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Chicago** recorded the longest average trip duration among the three cities.  
- **New York City** had the highest overall ridership volume.  
- **Washington** displayed more balanced user activity between genders.  
- Peak usage occurred during **weekday commute hours**, suggesting strong ties to urban mobility patterns.
